									<h1>Critical Analysis & Refinement of the Small Punch Test</h1>
									<p>As the capstone of my engineering degree, this project explores the advancement 
										of the Small Punch Test (SPT) as a tool for understanding and tracking material 
										degradation. By integrating experimental data, computational modeling, and 
										numerical analysis, I am developing a more accurate and efficient method for 
										assessing how materials degrade over time. This work not only enhances predictive
										maintenance and failure analysis in engineering systems but also highlights my 
										expertise in Finite Element Analysis (FEA), material science, and advanced 
										simulation techniques. Dive in to explore the progress so far and the potential 
										impact of this research on engineering diagnostics.</p>

									<h3>Project Overview</h3>
									<p id="indent">Currently in progress, this project aims to study and enhance a materials 
										testing method known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12540-019-00454-5">The Small Punch Test (SPT)</a>. Broadly, this research 
										pertains to the development and transition between internal stress states 
										that emerge throughout a small punch test. The specific focus if to further the understanding of
										specimen response behavior at different loading stages for a range of 
										materials with varying ductility. The small punch tests inherent sensitivit 
										to ductility entails prospective use to accurately track operational damage
										to engineering systems. To better understand relevant SPT behavior 
										mechanisms a Finite Element Model is developed and analysed. This is used
										hand in hand with experimental data and theoretical SPT analysis methods
										to critically analyze the contemporary definitions of a specimen's 
										behavior throughout a small punch test. The desired outcome, on a small
										scale, is to develop a more reliable toolset (FEA model included) to 
										conduct small punch testing. On a larger scale, the reduced material demand 
										and the potential for improved understanding of the test methodâ€™s capabilities 
										could help reduce waste and costs in the maintenance of engineering systems.</p>

									<h3>My Role</h3>
									<p id="indent">I am developing this project at <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/">Queensland University of Technology</a>, 
										under the supervision of <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/stuart-bell-573b1514">Dr. Stuart Bell</a>. As the sole student stakeholder 
										I am responsible for gathering and producing reference material, 
										developing the FEA model, and analyzing all results. In addition, 
										I'm responsible for maintaining consistent communication with my supervisor, 
										as well presenting and defending ongoing findings in front of panels of QUT 
										colleagues and professors.</p>

									<h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
									<p id="indent">
										The project faced technical difficulties when the model was initially being 
										developed in ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). Progress was hindered 
										by a lack of colleagues with sufficient expertise in APDL and a shortage of 
										online resources to troubleshoot coding issues. Without adequate support, 
										resolving errors and refining the model became increasingly challenging. To 
										overcome this, the focus was shifted to ANSYS Mechanical, which provided a 
										more intuitive development environment with better documentation. This 
										transition allowed for more efficient model development, ensuring the project 
										remained on track to meet deadlines.
									</p>
									<p id="indent">The initial prototype model presented several shortcomings. The main issues 
										were discrepancies between experimental and simulated force-displacement 
										curves, as well as invalid stress concentrations stemming from convergence 
										issues and simple bilinear material models. To overcome these limitations, 
										boundary conditions were refined, and Normal Lagrange methods were implemented 
										for better contact accuracy. Further, multilinear isotropic hardening models 
										were created with multilinear material data sourced from peer-reviewed journals.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Outcomes & Results</h3>
									<p id="indent">The project is still a work in progress. So far a Finite Element Model has been developed 
										following specimen and apparatus dimensions from ASTM E3205- 20. The overall system 
										has been simplified to an axisymmetric section to reduce computational demand as shown below.</p>
										<div class="image main">
											<img src="images/eq_plastic_strain.png" alt="" />
										</div>
									<p id="indent">The model uses a force driven die defined with transient loading conditions to simulate 
										quasi-static loading on the test specimen. Various materials are simulated using multilinear 
										isotropic hardening models with data sourced from peer reviewed journals. Experimental Small 
										Punch Test data has been collected from at QUT. As of now the model can output SPT results 
										qualitatively similar to experimental data of materials with moderate ductility. A summary 
										chart of both simulated and experimental results is presented below.

									</div>
									<p id="indent">The image above is an overlay of multiple simulated SPT instances from Ansys Mechanical, 
										as well as experimental data from 316L Steel. As shown the model is sensitive to the 
										variation in material properties and holds true to the expectation of punch resistance 
										increasing with material strength. 
									</p>
									<p id="indent">The stress states that emerge in the specimen through simulation also exhibit expected 
										behavior as it pertains to critical failure locations on a sample. The location of failure 
										for 316L samples can be seen just just below and slightly out from the center.</p>
									<div class="image main">
										<img src="images/spt_crack.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p id="indent">The simulated counterpart for 316L shows critical stress propagating in a manner analogous 
										to that of experimental samples.</p>
									<div class="image main">
										<img src="images/spt.gif" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p id="indent">The next step is to broaden the functionality of the model to highly brittle and highly 
										ductile materials. Subsequently, material property and SPT data will be collected 
										experimentally with a set of sample materials spanning a range of ductility. Material 
										property data will be used to redefine materials models and results from subsequent 
										simulations will be compared to those collected experimentally. Should all go as planned 
										this will serve as a checkpoint from which a final model can be derived, and study of 
										stress state propagation can begin.</p>
